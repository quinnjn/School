   \section{Compiling}
   Not required for Python

   \section{Execution}
   To execute, change the terminal directory to where this PDF file sits.
   Then in the terminal execute:
	\begin{alltt}
	python src/Q\QuestionNum.py
	\end{alltt}

  \section{Usage}
    No usage required, script is self automated
  \section{Explanation}
    The script will take in the Assignment\_Constraints.txt and it already knows about the domains listed in the assignment.

    The domains are:
    $D$=\{January 17th, 18th, ... April 9th\} - \{Februrary 17th, 18th, ... Februrary 24th\}

    The constraints are:
    $C$=\{January 23, January 29, February 1, February 6, February 14, February 16, March 3, March 5, March 6, March 8, March 20, April 3, April 8, April 9, A1 Due Date \textless A2 Due Date, A2 Due Date \textless A3 Due Date, A3 Due Date \textless A4 Due Date\}

    The program will search through N 0-4, and then X:0-100 for each N. Note on N, the assignments need to be atleast N days apart so if my N was 1, January 1 would be 1 N away from January 2 in this program.

    Each time we increase N, we check our current Domains against our constraints and remove Domains that no longer fit. Because N is just increasing the range that is an acceptable padding between constraints, by applying arc consistency we can remove Domains that violate the constraints at N. If we removed a set $A$ of Domains that would not fit with the constraints at N and a set $B$ of Domains that would not fit with the constraints at N+1 we would see that $A \subseteq B$. This allows for a better time complexity and a faster search of X by not having to recheck all Domains for every interval of N.

    The first Domain is always part of our solution since it is the earliest item, and now that I think about it the last Domain should technically
    be the last Domain of our solution because $minDomain < X < 2X < maxDomain$ could be our 4 elements. If I have time I will make this change.

    We continue to loop through X until we can no longer find a X that fits in the given domain.
